 The TPT VR System Client is a virtual reality application designed to offer an immersive and interactive experience within a customizable VR environment. Users can navigate through various virtual rooms, explore and favorite tiles, and personalize their surroundings using VR controllers. The client is built with Three.js and React-three-fiber for smooth 3D rendering and real-time interaction, while the backend is powered by a Node.js server that handles data retrieval and user interactions via a RESTful API. This setup provides a seamless, responsive, and engaging VR experience tailored to individual user preferences.
